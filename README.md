# flappy-bird
Our project is a recreation of the smash hit mobile game Flappy Bird. The objective is to simply avoid hitting the pipes and to get the highest possible score. Since Flappy Bird is always moving up or down, the trick is to time your taps such that the amplitude of the peaks and dips are short â€” short enough to fit through the pipes. Tap quickly, and tap regularly. The next trick is to learn to quickly recover your rhythm after you rise or fall to the right height for the pipe. You'll need to tap or double-tap up, or pause down, then get stable again really fast.
